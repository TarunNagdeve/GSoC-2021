# Coding Period

## Week 1 (7th June- 14th June 2021)
  
### Tasks to be accomplished:-
 1. Renaming the images in the dataset. <br />
 2. Preprocessing the images. <br />

### Estimated Time Required:- 1 week  <br />
#### Abstract
The dataset currently consists of 1261 color images and growing. We first need to rename the photos, as some of them have identical names that can create problems while giving the output. Also, we need some preprocessing on the images, like resizing each image to the same size, turning each image to a similar color scale, etc.
#### Status - All tasks Completed Successfully!

## Week 2 (15th June- 22th June 2021)
   
### Tasks to be accomplished:-
  1. Selecting a model to train the dataset.
  2. Developing a prototype

### Estimated Time Required:- 2 week  <br />
#### Abstract
After comparing the results from various models, It can be concluded that the VGG16 model is giving the best results so far. The VGG16 model has 16 layers and about 138 million (approx) parameters. Here we'll  be using the last layer, i.e., the 'fc2' layer for predictions. 
#### Status - Task 1 Completed Successfully!

## Week 3 (23th June- 30th June 2021)

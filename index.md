### Tasks to be accomplished:-
 1. Renaming the images in the dataset. <br />

#### Abstract
The dataset currently consists of 1261 color images. We first need to rename the photos, as some of them have identical names that can create problems while giving the output. Also, we need some preprocessing on the images, like resizing each image to the same size, turning each image to a similar color scale, etc.
